## 📄 Notes

This project was independently built as part of my RISE Internship web development task list, showcasing frontend development, UI/UX skills, and search/filter functionality.
Note: "Buy Now" and actual e-commerce checkout functionality are not included. This project is front-end only and focused on layout and interactivity.
